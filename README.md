###### For Mac Users

- Access Terminal in your Finder, and open a new window.
- Install the package manager in the Terminal, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), on your device by entering this line of code:
`$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
- Once homebrew is installed, install Git, a version control system for code writers, with this line of code: `brew install git`.
- Now, install Node.js through Homebrew with the following command: `brew install node`.
- Confirm that node and npm (Node's package manager that is automatically installed alongside Node) are on your working system with two command lines `node -v` & `npm -v`, respectively returning something resembling `v14.5.0` & `6.14.5` (or higher).

###### For Windows Users

- Open a new Command Prompt window by typing "Cmd" in your computer's search bar.
- Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running).
